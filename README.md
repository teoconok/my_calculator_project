# My project(Calculator)

All source code for a small STM32 calculator. This repository contains schematics and source code for STM32F103C8T6 (Folder "note" above is very important for configuring). Users are encouraged to refer to and customize this for their own small projects.

## My Journey to creating a small calculator  
This is my first project in my second year of university. I had a great time building this calculator, even though as a beginner, my programming can sometimes be a bit rough around the edges. When my friend and I decided to make this project, we were completely new - no ideas, no knowledge about PCBs, and not even a clue where to begin. That's why I spent a lot of time on the first step: Programming. I consulted libraries and learned how to make a simple calculator on YouTube, but the first week was pretty discouraging. The next week, a video about utilizing the LCD library significantly boosted my enthusiasm. Seeing some characters displayed on the LCD brought a huge grin to my face! Since then, I spent my spare time thinking of a reasonable algorithm for calculations that could be implemented in a small calculator. Initially, all values could be shown on the LCD in "int" format. My first obstacle was the operator. I wondered how the operator could be displayed. To handle operators, I decided to switch to an array format. All numbers were changed to "char" format and stored in an array. My program had two functions: processing all data for calculations while simultaneously displaying it on the LCD. During calculations, the array was split into two separate arrays; one array stored numeric values and converted them to "double" format, and the other array stored operators. Then the program combined the two arrays to perform calculations and display the results on the LCD. I've included some photos, and you can see the result displayed on the LCD. It might look complex due to the many small jumper wires connected inside.
I hope those who refer to this small project will learn new things as well as have the spirit to try their best with their own enthusiasm.
